# All Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project

We are assisting our client, Steve, in analyzing the stock market over the last few years in order to advise his parents on their investments. Steve wants the ability to analyze a greater number of stocks than the twelve that we had initially considered. We will accomplish this by refactoring our original code, allowing our program to run faster & to more efficiently process a greater amount of data.

### Purpose

Our goal is to analyze the performance of twelve stocks in 2017 & 2018 in a time faster than our original program. Our code will be designed to allow for the possibility of analyzing a greater number of stocks.

## Results

### Stock Performance in Each Year

2017 was a generally better year than 2018 for our twelve stocks. The combined total trading volume in each year is comparable at just over $3 billion. But our twelve stocks gained 67% in 2017 and lost 9% in 2018.

## Summary

###Refactoring Code



### Original Program & Refactored Program

- Theater campaigns almost always end with success more often than failure. Theater campaigns are most successful when commenced in May, and least so when commenced in December.

- Theater campaigns are most successful when the campaign goal is lower than $5,000.

- While the data set does contain the launch date and end date of each campaign, it does not contain the rate of funding for each campaign. For instance, Louise's campaign for *Fever* came close to its funding goal in a short amount of time. Understanding campaign outcomes based on the rate of funding for each campaign may reveal a pattern in campaign success and failure.

- A year-over-year visualization of campaign outcomes by launch date and a chart showing the number of campaigns for each goal category would each be valuable.
