# All Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project

We are assisting our client, Steve, in analyzing the stock market over the last few years in order to advise his parents on their investments. Steve wants the ability to analyze a greater number of stocks than the twelve that we had initially considered. We will accomplish this by refactoring our original code, allowing our program to run faster & to more efficiently process a greater amount of data.

### Purpose

Our goal is to analyze the performance of twelve stocks in 2017 & 2018 in a time faster than our original program. Our code will be designed to allow for the possibility of analyzing a greater number of stocks.

## Results

### Stock Performance in Each Year

2017 was a generally better year than 2018 for our twelve stocks. The combined total trading volume in each year is comparable at just over $3 billion. But our twelve stocks gained 67% in 2017 and lost 9% in 2018.

### Execution Time in Each Program

We have achieved a faster run time for our program by refactoring our code. Rather than using nested loops to process our data, we have initialized arrays and used a single loop to carry out our analysis. Each year runs at around 0.1 second.

## Summary

###Refactoring Code

By refactoring our code we are processing fewer steps, using less memory, and improving the program logic. It is similar to proofreading a thesis to get a coherent & concise argument.

### Original Program & Refactored Program

Refactoring the original VBA script has decreased the strain on our machine's memory, and allows the program to accept greater amounts of data for processing.
